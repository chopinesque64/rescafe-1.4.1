ResCafe Change Log
==================

1.4 -> 1.4.1
---------------
Changed to MIT License at the request of Alexei Svitkine

1.3 -> 1.4
---------------
Yea! Thanks to some tips from Peter Stuer <Peter.Stuer@pandora.be> I finally
got the 'icns' plugin working! I can now save 32-bit icons with alpha. I
tweaked a lot of the code so it can better locate the plugins and icons
directories. The doc menu is now alphabetized and can be traversed with
'Ctrl +' and 'Ctrl -'. Added a new application to the package called
'ResPresso' which is a command-line version much like the original 'macfork'.
It reuses the ResourceManager package and the plugin handlers. Very cool.

1.2.5 -> 1.3
---------------
Made some minor code modifications to solve problems I was having with
Java 1.3. Added an opening splash screen with notifications about the
loading procedure. Added the beginnings of an 'icns' plugin. Unfortunately
this does not parse the 32-bit components which really are the most 
important part of 'icns' )-;.

1.2 -> 1.2.5
---------------
Completely replaced Jimi with XpmImage for all code including plugins.
Also fixed ResCafe top class so multiple files can be loaded on the
commandline.


1.1 -> 1.2
---------------
Still more fun changes. Added support for mouse click sorting of
plugin display columns as well as optimal adjustment of the
column widths. Rearranged the plugin class hierarchy so almost
all plugins can take advantage of it. Also added a custom
XpmImage class that supports mask so icons will be properly
exported to XPM files. Added the beginnings of GUI windows to
track the loaded plugins and what they can handle.

1.0.1 -> 1.1
---------------
More radical changes. Added support for multiple open documents using the
new DocumentManager class. Open docs are accessible through a new
Documents menu.

1.0 -> 1.01      (NOTE: Unreleased)
---------------
Put icon loading and plugin scanning into Java Threads. The result is 
faster start up. Also added menu shortcuts and mnemonics.

0 -> 1.0
---------------
Initial Release
