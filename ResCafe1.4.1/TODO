TODO on ResCafe v1.1+

o Add a nifty splash screen on startup

o Manual under 'Help' menu

o Add support for multiple plugins for a single type. For example, one
  might want ti view 'icl8's with both 'Joe Bob's Icon Viewer' and 'Bubba's
  Deluxe Icon Handler'. The handlers could be stored in a Vector in the
  Handler Hashtable. A menu or option box could allow switching between
  types.

   o Along with the above, some kind of Property/Preference editor
     would have to be implemented to allow the user to choose the
     principle handler for a type rather than whatever got registered
     first.

o Type Groups - the user could customize groups of similar types to
  be displayed or saved. Examples might be
  "Icon" - 'icl4', 'icl8', 'cicn', etc.
  "Graphical" - Icons as well as 'PICT's, 'ppat's, etc. 
  "Multimedia" - Graphical as well as 'snd 's
  "Menu" - 'MENU', 'mbar', etc.

o Try to load/save Resources with threads

o Get plugin probing in JAR files working

o Add a separate hook for Resource Model devoted to the MacOS 'System'
  file. Other resource file may refer to resources in the 'System'.

Maybe more, if I can think of them...
