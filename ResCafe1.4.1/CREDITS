This work was inspired in large part by a C++ app called 'macfork'
by Andrew Willmott <ajw+macfork@cs.cmu.edu>

Special thanks go to Peter Stuer <Peter.Stuer@pandora.be> who explained the
format of Mac 32-bit icons such as 'il32', in particular the Run Length
Encoded (RLE) variety.

Thanks also go to Craig Hockenberry <craig@iconfactory.com> of the IconFactory
(http://www.iconfactory.com) who was good enough to answer my e-mail and refer
me to Peter.
